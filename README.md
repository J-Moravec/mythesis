# mythesis
Mythesis is LaTeX template for graduate and postgraduate theses. It was created to increase and easy adoption
of LaTeX amongst Massey University students, but anyone who likes it can use it.

Currently, due to bug in knitr and/or tikzDevice, style document `mythesis.sty` must be included in every folder
that contain child document with picture created by using knitr hook with `dev="tikz"`.

If you have any question or want help, feel free to write me mail: j.moravec@massey.ac.nz

If you are experienced user of LaTeX and you would like to help perfect this template, feel free to write me as well, commit
or fork this and create a better one:)


Enjoy the power of LaTeX.
